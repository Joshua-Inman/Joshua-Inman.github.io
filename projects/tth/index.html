        <h3>My League of Legends Career</h3>
          <p>I started playing League of Legends during the end of season three back in 2013. During that time period I had been playing the game on and off but it wasn't until I consistently started playing in season four. Season four was a very special ranked year for me. Not only was it my first time playing ranked before but I actually placed Silver and immediately climbed to Gold by the end of the 2014 season.
          </p>
          <p>It's now 2015 and season five has just began. With a relatively high rating for a new player I was eager to attempt to climb even higher this current season. Fast forward to the end of season five and I finished Platinum. I didn't really feel a sense of completion when I hit Platinum near the amount when I reached Gold my first season. With this empty feeling I sought out to reach Diamond. At the time I didn't think I was good enough but I kept playing disregarding my thoughts.
          </p>         
          <p>By the end of 2016 I had finally obtained diamond. I remember being so proud of myself as I never thought I would actually be capable of a diamond level player. It had felt like the most challenging and intimidating season yet although it was guaranteed the most rewarding one. So here we are now, it's 2017 and League of Legend’s current season is seven. I’ve played my placement matches and currently in Platinum, once again looking to climb back into diamond and maybe further. League of Legends is one of phew video games that has driven me to want to be better at something. It has set challenging goals for me and I have allowed it to drive my passion to achieve them.
